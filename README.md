## Substrate Save

Comprises a websocket server accepting incoming telemetry from multiple 
[Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) nodes. 
Telemetry will be stored in a SQL database. Management of the database schema is via diesel migrations.

Stored data is purged from the DB according to `LOG_EXPIRY_HOURS`

#### Routes:

- base is just for incoming telemetry (ws) - set with this option: `--telemetry-url 'ws://127.0.0.1:8080 5'`
- **/stats/db** - stats for db showing table / index sizes on disk
- **/nodes** - list of logged nodes
- **/nodes/{node ip address}/peer_counts** - peer count history for the 
given node ip address (will also match beginning of ip address, eg: w/wo port)
- **/nodes/{node ip address}/log_stats** - shows the quantity of each type of log message received
- **/nodes/{node ip address}/logs** - recent log messages, unprocessed
- **/nodes/{node ip address}/logs/{msg type}** - recent log messages, filtered by message type: `msg`

`peer_counts` and `logs` routes take the following optional parameters (with sensible defaults if not specified):
- `start_time` in the format: `2019-01-01T00:00:00`
- `end_time` in the format: `2019-01-01T00:00:00`
- `limit` in the format: `100`

### Set up for development and deployment

- (for development) create a `.env` file in project root containing: (eg) 
    - `DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost/save` 
    - `PORT=8080`
- install [Diesel cli](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/master/diesel_cli)
- you might need [additional packages](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/blob/master/guide_drafts/backend_installation.md)
- run `diesel database setup` to initialise DB
- after any changes to the schema via migrations, you must `diesel migration run`

Optionally specify the following environment variables:

- `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` (default: 5)
- `CLIENT_TIMEOUT` (default: 10)
- `PURGE_FREQUENCY` (default: 600)
- `LOG_EXPIRY_HOURS`  (default: 168)
- `MAX_PENDING_CONNECTIONS` (default: 8192)
- `DATABASE_POOL_SIZE` (default: 10)

To allow logging you must set:

- `RUST_LOG` to some log level

Limitations:

Log messages are batched together in each actor before `INSERT` 
\- up to 128 messages or 100ms, whichever is reached sooner. 
However, an insert is only triggered on receipt of a log message, 
(if the check on the above conditions is true). 
Batches are local to each actor in the system.
